When it comes to fitness, motivation is important, but consistency is key.

We predict that traffic to MDN will decline precipitously as developers realise they no longer need to look up JS array methods. We also expect Stack Overflow’s sister site, Prompt Overflow, to become one of the most popular sites on the internet in a matter of months.

## 2. Why Consistency is Crucial

Consistency ensures you make steady progress. A single workout might not seem like much, but when combined with regular sessions, it leads to sustainable progress over time. Consistency also helps you turn exercise into a habit, which eventually becomes part of your lifestyle. When fitness is a regular part of your day, you’re less likely to skip workouts. Additionally, regular exercise boosts mood, reduces stress, and enhances overall mental health. The more consistent you are, the more you'll experience the benefits.

## 3. Tips for Staying Consistent

Setting realistic goals is crucial to staying motivated and on track. Having clear, achievable goals gives you something to work toward and helps you stay focused. Creating a routine is another effective strategy—whether you prefer morning workouts or after-work sessions, having a set time each day to exercise helps build consistency. Tracking your progress is also helpful; keeping a log of your workouts and fitness milestones can be motivating as you see improvements over time. Finally, finding support, whether from a workout buddy or an online fitness community, can keep you accountable.
