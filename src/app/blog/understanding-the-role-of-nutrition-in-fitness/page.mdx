## 2. Macronutrients: The Building Blocks of Fitness

Protein is essential for muscle repair and growth. If you're strength training or trying to build muscle, it's important to consume adequate amounts of protein daily. Sources include lean meats, eggs, legumes, and plant-based proteins. Carbs are the body’s primary source of energy, especially during intense workouts. Choosing whole grains, fruits, and vegetables provides sustained energy without blood sugar spikes and crashes. Healthy fats, such as those found in avocados, nuts, and olive oil, are essential for hormone regulation and joint health. They also help with satiety and provide long-lasting energy.

## 3. Micronutrients and Hydration

Essential vitamins and minerals, such as calcium, iron, and magnesium, support various bodily functions. They are vital for bone health, muscle function, and energy production. Staying hydrated is crucial for optimal performance. Dehydration can impair strength, endurance, and focus during workouts. Drink water before, during, and after your exercise session to stay at your best.

## 3. Pre- and Post-Workout Nutrition

Eating a balanced meal 1-2 hours before exercising provides your body with the necessary fuel to perform. A combination of carbs and protein is ideal for energy and muscle support. After exercising, it's essential to replenish glycogen stores and promote muscle recovery. A protein-rich snack or meal within 30-60 minutes post-workout is recommended for muscle repair.
